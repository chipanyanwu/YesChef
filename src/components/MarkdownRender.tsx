**Saag Paneer (Spinach and Cheese Curry)** This recipe aims for a balanced flavor profile, but feel free to adjust spices to your preference. **Ingredients:** * **For the Paneer:** * 250g Paneer (Indian cheese), cubed * 1 tablespoon oil (vegetable or ghee) * **For the Saag (Spinach):** * 1 kg fresh spinach, thoroughly washed * 1 medium onion, finely chopped * 2 cloves garlic, minced * 1-inch ginger, grated * 1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference) * 1 tablespoon oil (vegetable or ghee) * 1 teaspoon cumin seeds * 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder * 1/2 teaspoon garam masala * 1/4 teaspoon red chili powder (optional) * 1/4 cup heavy cream (optional, for richness) * Salt to taste **Instructions:** 1. **Prepare the Paneer:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan. Gently fry the paneer cubes until lightly golden brown on all sides. This step is optional, but it gives the paneer a nicer texture. Remove the paneer and set aside. You can soak the fried paneer in warm water to keep it soft (optional). 2. **Prepare the Spinach:** Blanch the spinach by adding it to a pot of boiling water for 2-3 minutes, until wilted. Immediately drain the spinach and plunge it into ice water to stop the cooking process and preserve the color. Squeeze out as much excess water as possible. Roughly chop the spinach or puree it in a blender/food processor for a smoother texture. 3. **Make the Saag:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan or pot. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Add the chopped onion and sauté until golden brown. Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for another minute until fragrant. 4. **Add Spices:** Add the turmeric powder, garam masala, and red chili powder (if using). Sauté for 30 seconds, being careful not to burn the spices. 5. **Incorporate Spinach:** Add the pureed or chopped spinach to the pan. Mix well to combine with the spices. Add salt to taste. Cook the spinach on medium heat for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens slightly and the raw spinach taste disappears. 6. **Add Paneer:** Gently add the fried paneer cubes to the saag. Stir gently to combine. Simmer for another 5-7 minutes, allowing the paneer to absorb the flavors of the saag. 7. **Finish:** If desired, stir in the heavy cream for extra richness. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. 8. **Serve:** Serve the Saag Paneer hot with naan, roti, or rice. **Tips and Variations:** * **Fresh vs. Frozen Spinach:** You can use frozen spinach if fresh is not available. Thaw and squeeze out as much water as possible before using. * **Creamy Texture:** For a creamier texture, you can add a tablespoon or two of cashew cream (soaked cashews blended with water) along with the heavy cream. * **Smoked Flavor:** Some people like to add a smoked flavor to their Saag Paneer by giving it a *dhungar* – placing a small steel bowl with a burning piece of charcoal in the center of the saag, pouring a little ghee over the charcoal to create smoke, covering the pot tightly for a few minutes, and then removing the bowl. This is optional. * **Paneer Options:** If you can't find paneer, you can substitute with halloumi (though it will have a different texture) or firm tofu. * **Spice Level:** Adjust the amount of green chilies and red chili powder to control the spice level. * **Ginger Garlic Paste:** You can use ginger-garlic paste instead of freshly minced/grated ginger and garlic. * **Kasuri Methi:** Adding a teaspoon of crushed Kasuri Methi (dried fenugreek leaves) at the end enhances the flavour. Enjoy your homemade Saag Paneer!
